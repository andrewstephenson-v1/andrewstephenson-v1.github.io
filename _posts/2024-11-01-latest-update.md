Great news - the blog is now fully operational and deployed!

## Current Status

After working through some initial setup challenges, everything is now running smoothly:

- ✅ GitHub Pages configured and enabled
- ✅ Jekyll building successfully
- ✅ Multiple posts displaying correctly
- ✅ RSS feed available for subscribers

## Lessons Learned

Setting up a blog taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Patience with build times** - GitHub Actions takes a minute or two to build and deploy
2. **Importance of proper formatting** - Jekyll requires specific front matter formatting
3. **Date handling** - Posts dated in the future won't appear until that date arrives

## Looking Forward

Now that the foundation is in place, I'm excited to start sharing more meaningful content. Topics I'm planning to cover:

- Technical deep dives
- Project walkthroughs
- Tips and best practices
- Lessons from real-world experience

Thanks for following along on this journey!
