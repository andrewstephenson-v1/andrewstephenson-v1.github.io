Today I want to share my experience setting up this blog with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

## The Setup Process

GitHub Pages makes it incredibly easy to host a static site for free. Here's what I learned:

### Key Steps

1. **Create a repository** named `username.github.io`
2. **Add Jekyll configuration** with `_config.yml`
3. **Choose a theme** - I went with the clean and simple Minima theme
4. **Enable GitHub Actions** for automatic builds and deployment

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Free hosting** directly from GitHub
- **Version control** built-in with Git
- **Simple deployment** - just push to deploy
- **Custom domain support** available if needed

## What's Next?

I'm planning to customize the theme and add more functionality in upcoming posts. Follow along to see how the site evolves!
